- No HTTP/Swagger/validators in services.
- Only interacts with other domains via their **public services**.
- Throws **typed domain errors** only.
- Uses own repositories/ports; transactions where needed.
- Service DTOs are **pure TS**; mapping done at the controller/mapper.
- Clear decision on single vs split services; naming matches criteria.
- Logs/metrics at domain level; no transport concerns.
- If it creates entity repos, they are imported in the module via TypeOrmModule.forFeature.
