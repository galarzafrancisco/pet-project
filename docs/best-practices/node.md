# Best practices for Node applications
- Use TypeScript and `npm`.
- Use `nodenext` modules.
- If the application is part of a mono repo, extend base configuration.
- Avoid dependencies on `bun` and `deno`.
- Add npm scripts:
  - dev: runs the app with hot reload (watch mode) without compiling
  - build: compiles the app
  - start: runs the app from the compiled directory
  - test: runs tests
  - lint: runs a linter and fixes issues
