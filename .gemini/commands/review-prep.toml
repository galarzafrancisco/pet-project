Steps:
1. execute `.gemini/scripts/review-prep.sh` -- it will generate a `review.plan` file with a list of files changed that need to be reviewed.
2. Read the `review.plan` file.
3. Generate a more cohesive review plan that should:
- be a checklist style so the reviewer can tick tasks off when done.
- group / summarizing the changes to be reviewed by domain (e.g. backend controller, frontend component, shared package, type definitions, tests, etc).
- for each domain, suggest which review guides from `docs/review-guides` to use.
4. Write the review plan back to the `review.plan` file.
