Pre-requisite:
1. Ensure .gitignore includes
- node_modules
- .env
- dist
- .DS_Store
- any other files/folders that should not be tracked by git

Steps:
1. Add all changes to staging using `git add .` or specific files using `git add <file-path>`.
2. Make a commit message summarizing the changes made -- keep it short and descriptive.
3. Ask the user if they are okay with the commit message.
4. If the user approves, run `git commit -m "<commit-message>"`.
5. If the user disapproves, ask for a revised commit message and repeat step 3.
