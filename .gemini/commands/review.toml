Steps:
1. Read review plan from ``.ai/scratchpad/<feature-name>/review.plan`. -- If not found, run the `/review-prep` slash command first.
2. Start a review session using the review plan.
3. Write feedback in `.ai/scratchpad/<feature-name>/review.feedback.md`. Feedback should be:
- consumed by a dev to fix issues
- make it a checklist so that the developer can mark items as done
- organized by file path
- specific and actionable
- concise and to the point
- reference `docs/how-to-guides/<guide-name>.md` and/or `docs/best-practices/<practice-name>.md` where applicable
- if there are no issues, say "compliant with <<review guides used>>"
