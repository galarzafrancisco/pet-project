Please create a new git feature.

Pre-requisites:
1. Must be in `main` branch. If not, notify user and refuse to proceed.
2. Must have no uncommitted changes. If there are uncommitted changes, notify user and refuse to proceed.
3. User must provide a feature name or description.

Steps:
1. Validate pre-requisites.
2. Use `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>` to create and switch to a new feature branch.
3. Create a `.ai/scratchpad/<feature-name>/` directory for AI-related work.

If the user provided a description or goal:
- create a goal file at `.ai/scratchpad/<feature-name>/goal.md`
- make a high level plan for the feature and save it to `.ai/scratchpad/<feature-name>/plan.md`. Make it like a checklist so the user can check off tasks as they complete them.
- invoke the /dev slash command to implement the feature
